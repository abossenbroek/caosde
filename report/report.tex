\title{Lab Report Computational Aspects of Stochastic Differential Equations}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
Assuming the volatility to be constant, as is done in the seminal work by Black
and Scholes, can be too much of a simplification. In this work a stock process
is considered which has a drift term, volatility, modeled as a mean reverting
stochastic process. The stock process is given as:
\newcommand{\indst}{\ensuremath{^{(1)}}}
\newcommand{\indvl}{\ensuremath{^{(2)}}}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stock}
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma_t S_t dW_t\indst
\end{equation}
the volatility of the stock is defined to be:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:vol}
d\sigma_t = -(\sigma_t - \xi_t)dt + p\sigma_t dW_t\indvl
\end{equation}
which includes a mean reverting term $\xi_t$ defined as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mnrvrt}
\xi_t = \frac{1}{\alpha}(\sigma_t - \xi_t)dt
\end{equation}
The Brownian motions $W_t^{\{(1), (2)\}}$ in  equation \eqref{eq:stock} and
\eqref{eq:vol} are two independent identically distributed random variables.
They have the property that $W_0=0$ and $W_t - W_s \sim N(0, t - s)$ for $s <
t$.

\section{Numerical Methods}
\subsection{Stock Process}
To solve the stochastic differential equation (SDE) which models the stock 
process numerically three numerical methods are used. All methods rely on
rewriting the SDE in equation \eqref{eq:stock} to an It\=o process. For this two
auxiliary functions are introduced 
\begin{align}\label{eq:abstck}
a(S_t)&=\mu S_t&b(S_t)&=\sigma_t S_t.
\end{align}
Note that both functions do not include the independent variable $t$.  The
stock process can then be rewritten to:
\newcommand{\inttim}{\ensuremath{\int_{t_0}^{t}}}
\newcommand{\intdel}{\ensuremath{\int_{t}^{t + \Delta t}}}
\begin{equation*}
dS_t = a(S_t)dS_t + b(S_t)dW_t\indst
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation*}
S_t = S_0 + \inttim a(S_t)ds + \inttim b(S_t)dW\indst.
\end{equation*}
This value can only be approximated by taking a --infinitesimal-- small step
$\Delta t$ from $t$. The new value $S_{t + \Delta t}$ can be found using
different numerical methods. Three methods are discussed below.

\subsubsection{Euler Method}
The Euler method relies on computing the value of $a$ and $b$ as defined in
equation \eqref{eq:abstck}. For an It\=o process the Euler method is defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:euler}
X_{t + \Delta t} = X_t + a\Delta t + b\Delta W
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is the time step more commonly denoted as $h$ in numerical
mathematics and $\Delta W = \left(W\indst_{t + \Delta t} - W\indst_t\right)$.
Since $\left(W\indst_{t + \Delta t} - W\indst_t\right) =
Z\indst\sqrt{\Delta t}$ where $Z\indst\sim N(0, 1)$ the numerical
approximation can easily be found using the Euler method. Given a step size
$\Delta t$ the new stock value can be computed as:
\begin{align}
S_{t + \Delta t} = S_t + \mu S_t\Delta t + \sigma_t S_t Z\indst\sqrt{\Delta t}
\end{align}
where only $a(S_t)$ and $b(S_t)$ have to be computed, this in contrast to
subsequent methods.


\subsubsection{Milstein Method}
The Milstein method is a second method which can be used to compute the
numerical approximation of a SDE. The functions $a$ and $b$ as defined in
equation \eqref{eq:abstck} are used. In conjunction with these functions, the
Milstein method necessitates also $b'(S_t) = \sigma_t$. For an It\=o process
$X_t$ the Milstein method is defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mil}
X_{t + \Delta t} = X_t + a\Delta t + b\Delta W +
\frac{1}{2}bb'\left(\left(\Delta W\right)^2 - \Delta t\right)
\end{equation}
with $\Delta t$ and $\Delta W$ as defined before. For the SDE in
equation \eqref{eq:stock} the approximation is:
\begin{equation}
S_{t + \Delta t} = S_t + \mu S_t dt + \sigma_t S_t Z\indst\sqrt{\Delta t} +
	\frac{1}{2} \sigma_t^2 S_t \left(\left(Z\indst\sqrt{\Delta t}\right)^2 -
\Delta t\right)
\end{equation}
In contrast to the Euler method, the Milstein method not only requires to
compute $a(S_t)$ and $b(S_t)$, it also requires $b'(S_t)$.

\subsubsection{Runge-Kutta Method}
For a numerical approximation of a SDE using the Milstein method the
evaluation of $b'$ is necessary. However, in some circumstances $b'$ may be
unavailable or too expensive to compute. Therefore another numerical method
is also used. The Runge-Kutta method only necessitates the evaluation of $a$
and $b$ which similar to the Euler method. For an It\=o process $X_t$ the
Runge-Kutta method is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rk}
X_{t + \Delta t} = X_t + a\Delta t + b\Delta W + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\Delta
t}}\left(\left(\Delta W\right)^2 - \Delta
t\right)[b\left(\bar{X_t}\right)-b(X_t)]
\end{equation}
where $\bar{X_t}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\bar{X_t} = X_t + a\Delta t + b \sqrt{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
Applying this method to the stock process defined in equation \eqref{eq:stock}
the Runge-Kutta approximation can be computed as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\bar{S_t} &= S_t + \mu S_t\Delta t + \sigma_t S_t \sqrt{\Delta t}\\
S_{t + \Delta t} &= S_t + \mu S_t \Delta t + \sigma_t S_t Z\indst\sqrt{\Delta
t} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\Delta t}}\left(\left(Z\indst\sqrt{\Delta t}\right)^2 -
\Delta t\right)[\sigma_t\bar{S_t} - \sigma_t S_t]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
using this method the computational times can be decreased.

\subsection{Volatility Process}
In the previous section the numerical approximation of the stock process as
defined in equation \eqref{eq:stock} was discussed. In this section we will
discuss how the numerical approximation of the volatility process as defined
in equation \eqref{eq:vol} can be approximated. As with the stock process three
different numerical methods will be used. Since we already defined the Euler
method (see equation \eqref{eq:euler}), Milstein method (see equation
\eqref{eq:mil}) and Runge-Kutta method (see equation \eqref{eq:rk}) for an
It\=o process, this section will only discuss the applications of these
methods on the volatility process. For each approximation method we define $a$
and $b$ as follows:
\begin{align}
a(\sigma_t)&= -(\sigma_t - \xi_t) & b(\sigma_t) = p\sigma_t
\end{align}
The approximation of the volatility process using the Euler method can be
found with:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{t + \Delta t} = \sigma_t - (\sigma_t - \xi_t)\Delta t +
	p\sigma_tZ\indvl\sqrt{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
where $Z\indvl\sim N(0, 1)$ is independent from $Z\indst$.

The approximation of the volatility process using the Milstein method can be
found with:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{t + \Delta t} = \sigma_t - (\sigma_t - \xi_t)\Delta t +
	p\sigma_t Z\indvl \sqrt{\Delta t} + \frac{1}{2}p^2\sigma_t 
	\left(\left(Z\indvl\sqrt{\Delta t}\right)^2 - \Delta t\right)
\end{equation}

The Runge-Kutta method for the approximation of the volatility process is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\bar{\sigma_t} &= \sigma_t  -(\sigma_t - \xi_t)\Delta t + p\sigma_t 
	\sqrt{\Delta t}\\
\sigma_{t + \Delta t} &= \sigma_t - (\sigma_t - \xi_t)\Delta t 
	+ p\sigma_t Z\indvl\sqrt{\Delta t}
	+ \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\Delta t}}\left(\left(Z\indvl\sqrt{\Delta t}\right)^2 -
\Delta t\right)[p\bar{\sigma_t} - p\sigma_t]
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mean-Reverting Term}
A feature of the volatility process defined in equation \eqref{eq:vol} is that
it is mean reverting. The definition of the mean reverting term is given in
\eqref{eq:mnrvrt}. Since this function is deterministic the previous
stochastic approximation methods cannot be used. However, the numerical
approximation is essential. In subsequent sections the approximation error of
each individual stochastic numerical approximation will be the center of our
investigation. To reduce the approximation error originating from the
numerical integration of the mean reverting process a fourth-order
approximation method is used.  The Runge-Kutta numerical approximation method
(from this point forward revert to as the RK4) for the ordinary differential
equation defined in equation \eqref{eq:mnrvrt} is:
\begin{equation}
\xi_{t + \Delta t} = \xi_t + \frac{\Delta t}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
\end{equation}
where $k_{\{1, 2, 3, 4\}}$ are defined as:
\begin{align*}
k_1 &= \frac{1}{\alpha}(\sigma_t - \xi_t)\\
k_2 &= \frac{1}{\alpha}\left(\left(\sigma_t + \frac{\Delta t}{2}k_1\right) -
	\xi_t\right)\\
k_3 &= \frac{1}{\alpha}\left(\left(\sigma_t + \frac{\Delta t}{2}k_2\right) -
	\xi_t\right)\\
k_4 &= \frac{1}{\alpha}\left(\left(\sigma_t + \Delta t k_3\right) -
	\xi_t\right)
\end{align*}
With this last numerical approximation it is possible to implement the methods
in an algorithm and find solutions.

\section{Experiments}
Various experiments were conducted by means of computer programs which
implement the numerical approximations methods discussed in the previous
section. The first experiments investigate the impact of $p$ and $\alpha$ on
the behaviour of $S_{0 \leq t \leq T}$, $\sigma_{0 \leq t \leq T}$ and
$\xi_{0 \leq t \leq T}$. The second investigates the order of strong order of
convergence of each method. The last experiments are conducted to observe the
weak order of convergence.

\subsection{Process Behaviour}
In the stock price model which is central to this work the drift term of the
stock is $\mu$ and the diffusion term $\sigma_t$ is modeled as a stochastic
process. The diffusion term consists of a diffusion term which is dependent on
the mean of the process, $\xi_t$, and the diffusion $p$. The mean reverting
term $\xi_t$ includes a `smoothing' term $\alpha$. Two separate experiments
are run to study how the stock, volatility and mean reverting processes are
influenced by $\alpha$ and $p$. The first experiment is conducted to show the
impact of both parameters on a single stock process. The second demonstrates
how not only the stock process is influenced but also the two other processes.
Furthermore, the second study investigates several processes which permits to
draw more general conclusions.

The impact of $\alpha$ and $p$ on one realization of stock path is displayed
in figure \ref{fig:stockpath}. In each column a stock process is shown which has
the same sequence of normally distributed random number $Z^{(1)}_{1\leq t\leq
N}$ and $Z^{(2)}_{1\leq t\leq N}$. The difference is that each process has
different values for the two parameters which effect are being investigated.
From the figure can be concluded that an increase of the diffusion of the
volatility does not lead to an increase of the volatility of the stock
(volatility in the statistical sense and not in the sense of the model).
Comparing the movement of the stock process at a small $\alpha$ leads clearly
to less `spiky' paths. Especially the paths with a high diffusion term in the
volatility are more likely to smoothen when $\alpha$ decreases. We argue that
this is due to the fact that whenever $p$ is low the mean reverting term
$\xi_t$ remains constant and therefore the volatility remains also more
constant (note, $p$ is low). This leads the stock process to change only
marginally when $\alpha$ changes.

The figure also shows that the influence of the parameters is not the same for
all stock processes; the left process appears to converge to a process which
is mainly driven by drift whereas the right process looses its volatility only
locally.  However, also in the right figure increasing $p$ leads the process
to follow the drift more (compare with the processes with a low $p$ which
decrease over time instead of drifting upwards).

As discussed the impact of $\alpha$ and $p$ on the path of process is very
dependent on the sequence of random numbers with which the stock - and the
volatility path are generated. We argue that to be able to reason more in
general more realizations are needed. In figure \ref{fig:svxpaths} six triples
of a stock -, volatility and $\xi_t$ path are displayed for 30 processes. From
the figures which display the path of $\xi_t$ it becomes evident that always
reduces the diffusion of the mean reverting term. There is however no
considerable impact on the stock price. The behaviour of the stock price
changes considerably when $p$ is increased. An increase of this diffusion term
can lead to erratic movement of the volatility and thereby provoke stock
prices to be very volatile.

The values of the volatility - and the stock process are indexed at five
points in time. These values are grouped to construct box plots as shown in
figure \ref{fig:box}. These figures show that at a low $p$ most values can be
grouped in the second and third quartile and that few outliers exist. This is
in stark contrast to the case where $p$ is relatively high. Here the
difference between the second and third quartile is much smaller (the box is
smaller) and the many outliers exist (red crosses). This confirms the
statement we made in the previous paragraph. Furthermore, the plots of the
stock price show that the spread increases over time. This in contrast to the
volatility which remains more less constant. We argue that this is caused by
the mean reverting term. Although it was not obvious in figure
\ref{fig:stockpath} or \ref{fig:svxpaths} the average stock price follows the
drift term $\mu$ (see the red lines in the boxes).


\subsection{Strong Convergence}
Through experiments the order of strong convergence is sought. The three
numerical methods are implemented and tested with several step sizes. The
strong order order of convergence is defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:strng}
\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}(S_T - y_T^h) = O(h^\gamma)
\end{equation}
where $S_T$ is the analytic solution and $y_T^h$ is the approximation using
step size $h$. Since no analytical solution is at hand the value for $S_T$ is
approximated by using the numerical method with an infinitesimal step size of
$h = 0.0001$. To test the convergence each method is tested with the step
sizes  $h =$ 0.0002, 0.0005, 0.0008, 0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.008, 0.01, 0.02,
0.05 and 0.1. The last step sizes are essential if correct fits are to be
made. This because every method is reasonable accurate at small step sizes but
at larger step sizes the difference becomes more obvious.

To generate each path of $S_T$ and $y_T^h$ a sequence of random numbers is
required ($Z^{(1)}_{1\leq i \leq N}$ and $Z^{(2)}_{1\leq i \leq N}$). These
sequences are generated using a random number generator with a certain initial
state.  The influence of the random number generator and initial state is
assessed by running each experiment with two different random number
generators. Each random number generator is tested with three states. The
random number generators used in the experiments are the Mersenne Twister
\cite{matsumoto1998mtd} and BSD rand (part of the early BSD Unix operating
systems). The first has as period of $2^{19937} - 1$ \cite{Galassi:2006:GSL}.
This in contrast to the second which has a period of $2^{32}$ [ibid.].
Motivated by the initial seeds used by default in the current and previous
Mersenne-Twister generator implementations the three initial states 4357, 5489
and 1 are tested [ibid.].

To find the strong order of a numerical method the absolute error, the
absolute error is defined as $\epsilon = \sum_{i = 1}^N (S_T - y_T^h)$, is
fitted on a model $\epsilon = a \cdot h^{\widetilde{\gamma}}$. Since this
equation is non linear a constraint minimization algorithm\footnote{The Matlab
{\tt fmincon} function is used. See
\url{http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/optim/index.html}}
is used to find the values of $a$ and $\widetilde{\gamma}$. A summary of the
results is displayed in table \ref{tab:str}. From the results is clear that
the best approximation can be achieved with the Milstein method. The worst
results are surprisingly found using the Runge-Kutta method.

No clear evidence is available that the Mersenne Twister generator results in
better approximations than the BSD rand. For the Mersenne Twister there is no
obvious proof that a initial state should be preferred over the other. This is
not the case for the BSD rand generator. The quality of the approximation
found with initial state 4357 is better than the two others and the
approximation with state 3 is better than 5489. We argue that this shows that
the quality of the generator is not fit for the approximation of stochastic
differential equations since it can lead to distorted results.

\subsection{Weak Convergence}
In some applications of stochastic differential equations it can be of more
importance to have an accurate approximation of a moment. An approximation is
said to converge in the weak sense if:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weak}
\lvert \mathbf{E}(g(X_T)) - \mathbf{E}(g(y_T^h))\rvert =O(h^\beta)
\end{equation}
where $g(x)$ is a polynomial. To find the weak order of convergence of each
numerical method we proceed the same way as for the strong convergence. The
approximation of \eqref{eq:weak} is computed as:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \left\lvert \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n g(S_T) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n
g(y_T^h)\right\rvert
\end{equation}
for some polynomial $g(x)$. We can fit the $\epsilon$ on $h$ as with the
strong convergence and thereby find the weak order of convergence.

The results of the fit are summarized in table \ref{tab:weak1} for the weak
convergence in the mean and in table \ref{tab:weak2} for the convergence in
the variance. The results in both tables show that all the methods
are approximately equally accurate; all methods have a order of convergence
of approximately one.
